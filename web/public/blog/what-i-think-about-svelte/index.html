		<p class="blog-words">
			We know that the growing of Javascript is very fast. Maybe today you
			learn some Javascript framework, but maybe next month or even next day
			will come out another framework (ahhh sh*t here we go again). I think we
			as a Javascript developer have a lot of option to choose some tools that
			useful for us
		</p>

		<p class="blog-words">
			One of the Javascript framework that very interesting to me that is
			Svelte. Svelte is a Javascript frontend framework to build a user
			interface in a declarative way, like React or Vue. But, I think Svelte
			more than that. Basically, Svelte compiles your code to optimize
			Javascript code, Svelte will not bring the Svelte code itself to the
			browser, and the browser just receives the optimized Javascript code. I
			think the keyword "optimize" what I mentioned before will make sense to
			you if you know basic how Svelte compiles your code. Check out

		<p class="blog-words">
			Another advantage from Svelte is you will get a small bundle code and
			the performance is not inferior to the other framework, even Svelte has
			better performance in some situations (or even all situations). If you
			have a web application that is every part using another framework, for
			example, in the search bar using Vue or another part using React. Using
			Svelte is very easy to use in this situation because Svelte compiles
			your code to vanilla Javascript and lastly, you just link to the HTML
			code. If you want to learn more about the performance, I recommend you

		<p class="blog-words">
			What about developer experience???? Personally, I really like the
			developer experience at Svelte because I feel like I'm going back to
			when I first started learning web development, just HTML, CSS, and
			Javascript code without any fancy API or syntax that will make you
			confuse (use the platform).
		</p>

		<p class="blog-words">
			One of my favorite features from Svelte is scoped style, that's mean
			your style just affected to file itself and will not be affected other
			files, and unused style, that's mean if you have a lot of CSS code and
			maybe one of your code is unused CSS code, and Svelte will warn you and
			you can easily remove it without see the HTML code and come back to CSS
			code again.
		</p>

		<p class="blog-words">
			I will not show you some Svelte code because you can directly go to the
			<a
				rel="noopener"
				target="_blank"
				class="blog-link"
				href="http://svelte.dev/">documentation</a>
			and try yourself and feel some magic from it.
			<b class="blog-bold">Because in this blog I just give you what I think about Svelte. And
				Svelte help me a lot when I wanna built some complex frontend app
				without learning any framework with fancy API or syntax that will make
				me a headache and even sometimes I have to install another library to
				make my code work very well.</b>

			Summary, just choose tool that you neeed or useful for you

			Yeahh, that is what I think about Svelte.... Thanks Svelte üôè
