			<p class="blog-words">
				Maybe you think with this blog title, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS
				PHENOMENON". Yes, that's not wrong but many people do this phenomenon
				all the time. For example, if a new Javascript framework or library
				comes out and programmers in some groups or some forum say "SHOULD I
				LEARN THIS".
			</p>

			<p class="blog-words">
				If you just use that new framework or library just because it's very
				trending and a lot of people talk about it, I think why not change your
				perspective about this phenomenon. For example, why not try to visit the
				documentation and read about that framework or library. If you have
				time, find out why the author of the framework or library makes this
				thing, what problem the author solves, or even the philosophy behind
				this framework or library.
			</p>

			<p class="blog-words">
				For example, when I wanna learn another Javascript frontend framework,
				and that framework gives me a lot of productivity and the performance is
				also very good. Finally, I decided to choose Svelte, and Svelte solve my
				problem about productivity and performance.
			</p>

			<p class="blog-words">
				On the productivity side, Svelte gives me a lot of productivity while I
				am coding. For example, Svelte has a lot of features, for example,
				built-in transition, animation, state management, and more. Even Svelte
				give me some useful utilities that help me a lot, for example, scoped
				style, unused CSS code, and more.
			</p>

			<p class="blog-words">
				On the performant side, Svelte is not inferior to other Javascript
				frontend frameworks or even Svelte has better performance in some
				situations. And I'm also doing research on why Rich Harris (Svelte's
				author) makes Svelte, what problem he solves, and more.
			</p>

			<p class="blog-words">
				Yeahh, that is what I think about this phenomenon.... Thanks
